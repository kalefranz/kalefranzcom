	  typed, the user is not warned -The system lets us fix a limit for
	  the pre-pended message, however the text field itself does not
	  have a limit ( as in a MAXLENGTH attribute). Instead of that, if
	  I exceed the limit, then validate, the same form displays again,
	  with no warning whatsoever, but the text field truncated.

	  The other points will be explained to the customer

2007-10-24 14:13  basovink

	* ChangeLog is the right name

2007-10-24 14:10  basovink

	* New phplist version 2.10.6RC1

2007-10-24 14:07  basovink

2007-10-24 12:04  mdethmers

	* added cvs2cl.pl to scripts

2007-10-18 17:12  basovink

	* 0011996: forward to friend - personal message Added option to
	  allow user to add a personal note when forwarding 'to a friend'
	  The note is prepeded to both text and html messages and will be
	  stripped of all html

2007-10-17 10:50  basovink

	* #0011860: forward to friend, multiple emails This change will
	  allow for a maximum amount of forwards ('to a friend') to be sent
	  per day.  FORWARD_EMAIL_COUNT is a config setting, determines the
	  maximum to be sent per day. Default is 1 to not change behaviour
	  for exisiting installations. Recommended values between 3 and 20
	  FORWARD_EMAIL_PERIOD is a hidden setting. defaults to 1 day.
	  Basically exists to prevent people form spamming (albeit
	  inadvertedly) while keeping the possibility to sent to another
	  friend a few days later when you happen to reread the newsletter.

2007-10-12 16:31  basovink

	* #0011857: forward to friend, retain attributes When forwarding
	  ('to a friend') the message will be using the attributes of the
	  destination email by default. This often means the message gets
	  stripped of al its attributes. When setting the
	  KEEPFORWARDERATTRIBUTES constant to 1, the message will use the
	  attributes of the forwarding user. It can be used to connect the
	  destinatory to the forwarder and/or reward the forwarder.

2007-09-03 14:49  mdethmers

	* new phplist version 2.10.5

	  website

2007-08-27 11:04  basovink

	* some comments added

2007-08-27 11:04  basovink

	* 0008210: 2.10.3 Upgrade fails to update tables A page named
	  reindex.php was build to recreate all indexes from the
	  structure.php file. To prevent long waiting times on large
	  databases, this code is not included in upgrade.php. For large
	  databases it is useful to run this page.

	  Check the function and use of the file in the file itself.

2007-08-27 10:01  basovink

	* 0008898: getrss bug for chinese rssitem title in UTF-8 encoding
	  Suggestion adopted

2007-08-23 16:55  basovink

	* 0008897: Incorrrect count in users.php when owner role applied
	  Added DISTINCT to sql queries Commented admin/users.php Tidied
	  code

2007-08-23 14:40  basovink

	* 0008919: $ symbols within feeds are interpreted as variables at
	  send time Suggested fix has been tested and it works indeed

2007-08-21 16:26  basovink

	* 0010828: Possible faulty insert; Database error 1062 while doing
	  query Duplicate entry 'Untitled Template' for key 2

	  When adding a template with an existing name this generates an
	  1062 error and the 'Untitled Template' tupel appears.

	  Changed temporary name to the $title field, which solves this
	  issue.

2007-08-21 15:28  basovink

	* 0005786: System messages don't parse [DOMAIN] or [WEBSITE]

	  I tested and can confirm this happens when you enter [DOMAIN] and
	  use Save and Activate. Using other scenario's I could not
	  reproduce this issue.

	  Replacing [DOMAIN] with the domain gets done in
	  defaultconfig.getConfig. This function is only called when
	  building the page, as we do after 'Save'ing the page. After an
	  'Activate' the page is only stored. defaultconfig.getUserConfig
	  is used when sending mail.

	  Added parsing of [DOMAIN\] and [WEBSITE\] to getUserConfig.

	  Parsing should be done only in one place. So maybe Later: Combine
	  getConfig and this one?

2007-08-13 15:07  hernol

	* #4215 - Changed if ($var) to if (!empty($var)) for select and
	  radio

2007-08-09 15:29  basovink

	* 0008980: Link Conversion for Click Tracking. No = will be added
	  if key is empty.

2007-08-08 16:48  basovink

	* 0005862: Corrections to german user interface, using proper HTML
	  entities Patches applied

2007-08-08 11:16  basovink

	* dbg() updated again automatic variable name didn't work very well

2007-08-07 13:37  hernol

	* #8960 - applied suggested fix

2007-08-07 13:13  hernol

	* #8989 - added javascript alert to "radio" and "checkbox"

2007-08-07 11:20  basovink

	* 0008870: It doesn't show the message of alert in the checkbox
	  fields Fixed checking code, it will now require all required
	  fields. (Javascript in the page will not check other type then
	  textline but php will). Changed order of messages also. It will
	  first require all required fields and then ask to subscribe to at
	  least one list.

	  Be aware that requiring a checkbox means requiring it to be
	  CHECKED. If you want to force a yes or no choice try 2 option
	  buttons ('radio') or a dropdown. A 3 state checkbox could solve
	  this but is basically a bad interface choice.

2007-08-06 13:23  basovink

	* dbg() finds variable name by itself

2007-08-06 10:33  basovink

	* 0008854: Missing spaces in prependmailtext in
	  lan/en/reconcileusers.php When printing message for user emails
	  the template text is missing spaces which affects some mail
	  clients that remove line breaks when displaying incoming emails.
	  This tweak should have no visible impact on those that do not
	  remove the line breaks.

	  Also checked other languages, they seemed allright on this point

2007-08-02 17:49  basovink

	* I build a solution which will  cleanup  links. This is still out.
	  It must be rigidly tested before we will probably enable it in
	  2.11

	  Anyone interested in providing testresults: the url cleanup code
	  can be enabled by uncommenting 2 lines in sendemaillib.php. These
	  can be found using this issue's number (0008857) They should be
	  around line 175.

2007-08-02 16:47  hernol

	* #8998 - fixed, wrong variable

2007-07-24 17:08  basovink

	* 0009687: Confusing use of the word "Both", indicating one email
	  with both text and html and not two emails

	  Changed (hopefully) all displaying of 'text and HTML' to 'HTML'
	  Removed 'text and HTML'  option from interface Database untouched
	  Statistics will only show 'HTML' but will add the existing 'text
	  and HTML' count to it HTML will always include a  text MIME
	  multipart Removed or commented out the string  'text and HTML'
	  from all translation and help files.

2007-07-24 11:41  hernol

	* #10084 -  Added a note in the lan/en/admin.php file explaining
	  password must have 4 char or more

	Initial revision


Moved to CVS, changelog is supposed to be automatic now :-)

Old changelog before CVS:

1.1.7 1 Aug 2001
* added importing of lists of emails, part of code contributed by Kaare Christensen, kaare@mermaidconsulting.com
* finally add italian which had been contributed ages ago

1.1.6 12 Jun 2001
* wrapped it all up and published

1.1.5 6 Jun 2001
* added finding a user
* added dynamic selection of stylesheets

1.1.5b 5 Jun 2001 (oops, half a year later)
* added upgrading
* ben made me a nice design
* made stress testing a bit more useful
* some minor fixes related to redesign
* added confirmation of subscription

1.1.4b 6 Dec 2000
* bug in editlist
* bug in deleting a message
* bug in users, not showing no of msgs

1.1.3b 26 October 2000
* showing attributes when viewing user
* typo in unsubscribe_url
* problem with message footer
* host not exported to processing
* added exporting to CSV

1.1.2b 17th October 2000
* bug in members, when adding single user
* added checking for other running send processes, to avoid too many clogging up the machine
  and making the other crawl to a halt

1.1.1b 16th October 2000 - released in beta
* started using PHP4 specific stuff, PHP3 will not work any more
* separated db calls to allow for extension to other DBs
* separated user interface strings to allow translations
* made user attributes databased for more flexible configuration, with loads of consequences:
  - process queue has different method to find users.
  - subscribe uses new listing
  - admin uses new strucure
* users now get UNIQID, which allows them to go back and get their details directly
  (ie site "remembers" them).
* more items for a list or a message, prefix, footer, ordering
* paged listing of users when over 50, both in "all users" and "list membership"
* actions on userlists, move or delete multiple
* changed all files to .php instead of .php3

1.0.1 September 2000 (not published)
* moved config and connect to admin dir to allow password protection of docs
* bit more error capturing
* more help information
* some bugs removed
* different formatting of outgoing from-email

1.0 initial release. April 2000.
